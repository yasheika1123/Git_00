## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
all mimsy were the borogoves  
and the mome raths outgrabe

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

A governor it was proclaimed this time,  
When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire  
Ancestral memories might come together.  
And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow,  
A rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off,  
And sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone  


## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->


"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright â€”  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

A Dream Within A Dream by Edgar Allan Poe  
Take this kiss upon the brow!  
And, in parting from you now,  
Thus much let me avow--  
You are not wrong, who deem  
That my days have been a dream;  
Yet if hope has flown away  
In a night, or in a day,  
In a vision, or in none,  
Is it therefore the less gone?  
All that we see or seem  
Is but a dream within a dream.  

I stand amid the roar  
Of a surf-tormented shore,  
And I hold within my hand  
Grains of the golden sand--  
How few! yet how they creep  
Through my fingers to the deep,  
While I weep--while I weep!  
O God! can I not grasp  
Them with a tighter clasp?  
O God! can I not save  
One from the pitiless wave?  
Is all that we see or seem  
But a dream within a dream?
